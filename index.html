                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    [cite_start]I am a Master's student in Computer Science at the University of Tehran with a focus on Artificial Intelligence, holding a GPA of 19.46/20[cite: 64].
                </p>
                <p>
                    [cite_start]My research interests lie at the intersection of <strong>Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)</strong>, <strong>Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)</strong>, and <strong>Machine Learning</strong>[cite: 7, 11]. [cite_start]I am driven by the goal of building data-driven systems that genuinely help people in their everyday lives[cite: 78]. [cite_start]This passion led me to join the Human and Robot Interaction Lab (TaarLab), where I've worked on challenges in robotic scene rearrangement using the AI2-THOR simulator[cite: 25, 68]. [cite_start]A part of this work grew into my first published paper[cite: 71].
                </p>
                <p>
                    [cite_start]During my Master's, I've had the opportunity to dive deeper into machine learning, implementing a state-of-the-art CNN-LSTM model for human activity recognition[cite: 74]. [cite_start]This project resulted in my selection for the University of Tehran's team for the SHL 2025 Human Activity Recognition Challenge, and our work was subsequently accepted for publication at UbiComp 2025[cite: 75, 76].
